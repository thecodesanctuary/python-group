FUNCTIONS
1.  Write a function called merge that takes two already sorted lists of possibly different lengths, and merges them into a single sorted list.
(a) Do this using the sort method.
(b) Do this without using the sort method.

2. (a) Write a function called primes that is given a number n and returns a list of the first n primes. Let the default value of n be 100.
(b)Modify the function above so that there is an optional argument called start that allows the list to start at a value other than 2. The function should return the first n primes that are greater than or equal to start. The default value of start should be 2.

3.	Write a function called change_case that given a string, returns a string with each uppercase letter replaced by a lower case letter and vice-versa.

4.	Write a function called matches that takes two strings as arguments and returns how many matches there are between the strings. A match is where the two strings have the same character at the same index. For instance, 'python' and 'path' match in the first, third, and fourth characters, so the function should return 3.

5.	Write a function called one_away that takes two strings and returns True if the strings are of the same length and differ in exactly one letter, like bike/hike or water/wafer.
