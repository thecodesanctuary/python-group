LISTS
1 Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of integers. Do the following:
(a) Print the total number of items in the list.
(b) Print the last item in the list.
(c) Print the list in reverse order.
(d) Print Yes if the list contains a 5 and No otherwise.
(e) Print the number of fives in the list.
(f) Remove the first and last items from the list, sort the remaining items, and print the result 
(g) Print how many integers in the list are less than 5.

2. Write a program that generates a list of 20 random numbers between 1 and 100.
(a) Print the list.
(b) Print the average of the elements in the list.
(c) Print the largest and smallest values in the list.
(d) Print the second largest and second smallest entries in the list
(e) Print how many even numbers are in the list.

3. Start with the list [8,9,10]. Do the following:
(a) Set the second entry (index 1) to 17
(b) Add 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list
(c) Remove the first entry from the list
(d) Sort the list
(e) Double the list
(f) Insert 25 at index 3 
The final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17]

4. Create the following lists using a for loop.
(a) A list consisting of the integers 0 through 49
(b) A list containing the squares of the integers 1 through 50.
(c) The list['a','bb','ccc','dddd',. . .]
that ends with 26 copies of the letter z.

5. Write a program that takes any two lists L and M of the same size and adds their elements together to form a new list N whose elements are sums of the corresponding elements in L and M. 
For instance, if L=[3,1,4] and M=[1,5,9], then N should equal[4,6,13]
